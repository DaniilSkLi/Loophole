    "description": "This library is designed to provide security to freelancers, as well as others in order to provide secure access to the site without the admin panel. When can it be useful? If you are a freelancer and you have been scammed, you can run some system command on the server to delete everything. In other cases, for example remote control of the site via POST API. In general I make this package for myself but I'm putting it here so someone can use it and not have to write new code every time. I will be glad if I help someone :) Translated by DeepL translator.",
